README file for the algorithm of the paper "Neighbor affinity based algorithm for discovering temporal protein complex from dynamic PPI network".
This program can be successfully compiled with gcc version 4.8.4. 
The DPIN directory contains the time course protein interaction networks used in this work.

Example:
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main pin.txt cluster.txt

pin.txt:	the input PPI network of which each line contains two proteins sperating by tab.
cluster.txt:	the file name of clustering result.
